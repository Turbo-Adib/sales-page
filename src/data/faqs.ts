    question: "Can I really make money without showing my face?",
    answer: "YES! 87% of our six-figure students never show their face. Our AI tools write scripts, create voiceovers, and even generate visuals. Sarah Chen makes $87K/month using only stock footage and AI voices. David Park hit $156K/month with screen recordings. The faceless approach actually converts BETTER because viewers focus on value, not personality."

    question: "How fast can I realistically hit $10K/month?",
    answer: "Our average student hits $10K/month within 30 days. The Script Psych AI creates viral content in 60 seconds, so you're not wasting months learning. Jake Wilson went from $1K to $93K/month in 8 weeks. The key is our 'Zero to $10K in 30 Days' module - it's a paint-by-numbers system that removes all guesswork."

    id: "3",
    question: "Do the AI tools really work or is it just hype?",
    answer: "Our AI tools have generated over $50M for students. Script Psych Architect (worth $497/month) writes better hooks than 99% of humans. It's trained on 100M+ viral videos. Marcus Rodriguez credits the AI tools for his $112K/month income. You get lifetime access to tools that cost us $2M to develop. This isn't ChatGPT - it's specialized AI for viral content."

    id: "4",
    question: "I work full-time. Can I do this with 2 hours per day?",
    answer: "That's exactly what our system is designed for! The AI creates 30 videos in 2 hours. You batch everything on Sunday, then the automation posts across 7 platforms all week. Emma Thompson built to $94K/month while working as an accountant. Most students keep their job until they hit $50K/month (usually month 3)."

    question: "What if I'm an introvert or camera-shy?",
    answer: "Perfect! This system was BUILT for introverts. No face, no voice (if you want), no personal brand needed. Use AI voices, stock footage, screen recordings - whatever feels comfortable. Aisha Patel was too depressed to leave her room, now makes $73K/month with motivational content using AI. Being faceless is actually an advantage - you can create content about anything."

    id: "6",
    question: "Is there ongoing support after I purchase?",
    answer: "Yes! You get lifetime access to our private mastermind community with 10,000+ creators, weekly live Q&A calls with our team, and continuous course updates as platforms evolve. Plus, you can always reach out to our support team for technical help."

    question: "Why is this 10X more expensive than other courses?",
    answer: "Because it actually works. Cheap courses give you theory. We give you $2M worth of AI tools, proven systems from 500+ millionaire creators, and results. Our students average $87K/month. Would you rather save $900 on a course or make an extra $87,000 every month? The AI tools alone are worth $4,997/month if bought separately."

    question: "Do I need expensive equipment or software?",
    answer: "No! 90% of viral content is filmed on smartphones. We show you how to create professional-quality videos with just your phone and free editing apps. As you grow, we recommend upgrades, but they're not necessary to start. Emma Thompson hit 670K followers using just her iPhone."

    question: "Does this work for boring niches like finance or real estate?",
    answer: "'Boring' niches actually make MORE money! Finance creators average $127K/month in our program (vs $87K overall average). Why? Less competition, higher ticket offers. Our AI makes any topic entertaining. A student teaching accounting hits 5M views per video. The more 'boring' your niche, the more money you'll make."

    question: "What's your refund policy? Is this a scam?",
    answer: "30-day 'Go Viral Or It's Free' guarantee. If you don't see massive growth, get every penny back. No hoops, no questions. We've paid out $127M to students - scams don't do that.
