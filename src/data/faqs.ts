    question: "Can I really work from anywhere in the world?",
    answer: "YES! All you need is a laptop and internet connection. Our students are creating content from Bali beaches, European cafes, their RVs, and even while traveling full-time. The beauty of content creation is true location independence - your office is wherever you want it to be."

    question: "How quickly can I quit my 9-5 job?",
    answer: "Most students start seeing significant income within 30-60 days. We've had students quit their jobs in as little as 3 months, though we recommend having 3-6 months of savings first. The timeline depends on your consistency and following our proven system."

    id: "3",
    question: "What kind of lifestyle can I afford at $10K/month?",
    answer: "At $10K/month, you can live like royalty in most countries. Think beachfront villas in Bali for $1,500/month, European adventures, first-class travel, and still save more than most people making $100K in a corporate job. Plus, no commute costs, work clothes, or expensive city living."

    id: "4",
    question: "Do I need to show my face or use my voice?",
    answer: "Not at all! The entire course is focused on faceless content creation using AI voices and tools. You can build a successful channel without ever revealing your identity. We teach you exactly how to create engaging content anonymously."
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "What if I have a family? Is this lifestyle still possible?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many of our most successful students are parents who wanted more time with their kids. Imagine being present for every milestone, taking month-long family vacations, and giving your children experiences instead of just things. The flexibility is perfect for family life."
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "How much time do I need to invest daily?",
    answer: "You can start with just 1-2 hours per day. Once you systematize your workflow using our templates and AI tools, many students create and publish content in under 30 minutes per video. That's less time than most people spend commuting!"

    id: "7",
    question: "What platforms does this work for?",
    answer: "The strategies work across all major short-form platforms including TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Reels. The algorithm principles are universal, so you can apply these techniques anywhere."

    id: "8",
    question: "Is this just another 'get rich quick' scheme?",
    answer: "No, this is a real business model that thousands are using to build sustainable income. It requires work and consistency, but the difference is you're building an asset (your audience) that pays you for years, not trading time for money like a traditional job."
  },

    id: "9",
    question: "What if I don't have money for expensive tools?",
    answer: "We focus on free and low-cost AI tools. You can start with completely free options and upgrade as you grow. The course includes a comprehensive list of free alternatives for every tool we recommend."

    id: "10",
    question: "Can I really make money while I sleep?",
    answer: "Yes! Once your content is posted, it works 24/7 gaining views and generating income. Our students regularly wake up to hundreds or thousands of dollars earned overnight. Your content becomes employees that never stop working for you."
